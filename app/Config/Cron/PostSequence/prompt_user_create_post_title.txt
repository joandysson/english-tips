Generate 40 unique and creative blog post ideas related to learning English, targeting students from beginner to advanced levels.
The ideas should include a wide range of helpful and engaging topics for people learning English for everyday life, travel, study, or work.

The blog posts must be distributed evenly and sequentially across the 8 predefined categories listed below. After reaching category 8, the cycle should repeat starting from category 1, and so on.

Categories and their numeric IDs:

2. Vocabulário
3. Inglês para Viagem
4. Inglês para Trabalho
5. Dicas de Estudo
6. Curiosidades
7. Inglês Avançado
8. Exercícios

Each blog post idea must include:

A compelling and original title in Portuguese
A short and clear description in Portuguese (max 200 characters)
The corresponding category ID as a number from 1 to 8, under the key "category"

Use the category IDs in order (1 to 8), then repeat the cycle.
Example: Post 1 → category 1, Post 2 → category 2, ..., Post 8 → category 8, Post 9 → category 1, etc.

All ideas must be creative, helpful, practical, and educational. Avoid repetition or generic titles. Do not copy from existing websites or articles.

    "category_id": 1
  },
