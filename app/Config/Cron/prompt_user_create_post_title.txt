Generate 30 unique and creative blog post ideas related to technology, including a wide range of interesting, relevant, and emerging tech topics.

Distribute the 30 ideas equally across the following categories: "Tools", "Web Development", "AI", and "Others" (i.e., 7 or 8 ideas per category). Categories must be balanced.

Each blog post idea must include:
- A compelling and original **title** in Portuguese
- A short **description** in Portuguese (max. 200 characters)
- The appropriate **category**, written exactly as "Tools", "Web Development", "AI", or "Others"

You may include topics like futuristic tech, AI, programming, developer tools, new frameworks, digital privacy, tech ethics, quantum computing, and other tech-adjacent ideas.

Do not repeat ideas or copy existing content from the web. Be creative, insightful, and helpful.

Return only a JSON array with this format:
[
  {
    "title": "Post title here",
    "description": "Short description in Portuguese, max. 200 characters",
    "category": "One of the four categories above"
  },
  ...
]

The output must contain exactly 30 objects.
