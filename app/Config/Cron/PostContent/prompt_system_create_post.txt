      <ul class="mb-3">
          <li>I need to <strong>do</strong> my homework.</li>
          <li>She <strong>makes</strong> delicious cakes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h6 class="fw-semibold text-danger mb-2">✗ Incorreto:</h6>
      <ul>
          <li>I need to <strong>make</strong> my homework.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
